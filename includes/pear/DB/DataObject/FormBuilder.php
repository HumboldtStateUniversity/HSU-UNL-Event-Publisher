/**
 * This package helps with type and foreign key aware rapid development of forms
 * as well as many options to allow the advanced features to be used in a production
 * environment.
 *
 * All the settings for FormBuilder must be in a section [DB_DataObject_FormBuilder]
 * within the DataObject.ini file (or however you've named it).
 * If you stuck to the DB_DataObject example in the doc, you'll read in your
 * config like this:
 * <code>
 *  $config = parse_ini_file('DataObject.ini', true);
 *  foreach ($config as $class => $values) {
 *      $options = &PEAR::getStaticProperty($class, 'options');
 *      $options = $values;
 *  }
 * </code>
 * Now you're ready to go!
 *
 * You can also set any option through your DB_DataObject derived classes by
 * prepending 'fb_' to the option name. Ex: 'fb_fieldLabels'. This is the
 * preferred way of setting DataObject-specific options.
 *
 * You may also set all options manually by setting them in the DO ir FB objects.
 *
 * You may also set the options in an FB derived class, but this isn't as well
 * supported.
 *
 * In addition, there are special methods you can define in your DataObject classes for even more control.
 * <ul>
 *  <li>preGenerateForm(&$formBuilder):
 *   This method will be called before the form is generated. Use this to change
 *   property values or options in your DataObject. This is the normal plave to
 *   set up fb_preDefElements. Note: the $formBuilder object passed in has not
 *   yet copied the options from the DataObject into it. If you plan to use the
 *   functions in FB in this method, call populateOptions() on it first.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>postGenerateForm(&$form, &$formBuilder):
 *   This method will be called after the form is generated. The form is passed in by reference so you can
 *   alter it. Use this method to add, remove, or alter elements in the form or the form itself.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>preProcessForm(&$values, &$formBuilder):
 *   This method is called just before FormBuilder processes the submitted form data. The values are sent
 *   by reference in the first parameter as an associative array. The key is the element name and the value
 *   the submitted value. You can alter the values as you see fit (md5 on passwords, for example).
 *  </li>
 *  <li>postProcessForm(&$values, &$formBuilder):
 *   This method is called just after FormBuilder processed the submitted form data. The values are again
 *   sent by reference. This method could be used to inform the user of changes, alter the DataObject, etc.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>getForm($action, $target, $formName, $method, &$formBuilder):
 *   If this function exists, it will be used instead of FormBuilder's internal form generation routines
 *   Use this only if you want to create the entire form on your own.
 *  </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note for PHP5-users: These properties have to be public! In general, you can
 * override all settings from the .ini file by setting similarly-named properties
 * in your DataObject classes.
 *
 * <b>Most basic usage:</b>
 * <code>
 *  $do =& new MyDataObject();
 *  // Insert "$do->get($some_id);" here to edit an existing object instead of making a new one
 *  $fg =& DB_DataObject_FormBuilder::create($do);
 *  $form =& $fg->getForm();
 *  if ($form->validate()) {
 *      $form->process(array(&$fg,'processForm'), false);
 *      $form->freeze();
 *  }
 *  $form->display();
 * </code>
 *
 * For more information on how to use the DB_DataObject or HTML_QuickForm packages
 * themselves, please see the excellent documentation on http://pear.php.net/.

     * <?php
     * class DataObject_SomeTable extends DB_DataObject {
     * //...
     *   var $fb_crossLinks = array(array('table' => 'crossLinkTable'));

     * Where crossLinkTable is the name of the linking table. You can have as
     * many cross-link entries as you want. Try it with just the table ewntry
     * first. If it doesn't work, you can specify the fields to use as well.
     * <code>
     * 'fromField' => 'linkFieldToCurrentTable' //This is the field which links to the current (from) table
     * 'toField' => 'linkFieldToLinkedTable' //This is the field which links to the "other" (to) table
     * </code>
     * To get a multi-select add a 'type' key which it set to 'select'.
     * <code>
     * <?php
     * class DataObject_SomeTable extends DB_DataObject {
     *     //...
     *     var $fb_crossLinks = array(array('table' => 'crossLinkTable', 'type' => 'select'));
     * }
     * ?>
     * </code>
     * An example: I have a user table and a group table, each with a primary
     * key called id. There is a table called user_group which has fields user_id
     * and group_id which are set up as links to user and group. Here's the
     * configuration array that could go in both the user DO and the group DO:
     * <code>
     * <?php
     * $fb_crossLinks = array(array('table' => 'user_group'));
     * ?>
     * </code>
     * Here is the full configuration for the user DO:
     * <code>

     * A reverseLink is a table which links back to the current table. For
     * example, let say we have a "gender" table which has Male and Female in it
     * and a "person" table which has the fields "name", which holds the person's
     * name and "genre_id" which links to the genre. If you set up a form for the
     * gender table, the person table can be a reverseLink. The setup in the
     * gender table would look like this:
     * <code>
     * <?php
     * class DataObject_Gender extends DB_DataObject {
     * //normal stuff here
     * 
     *   var $fb_reverseLinks = array(array('table' => 'person'));
     * }
     * ?>
     * </code>
     * Now a list of people will be shown in the gender form with a checkbox next
     * to it which is checked if the record currently links to the one you're
     * editing. In addition, some special text will be added to the end of the
     * label for the person record if it's linked to another gender.
     * 
     * Say we have a person record with the name "Justin Patrin" which is linked
     * to the gender "Male". If you view the form for the gender "Male", the
     * checkbox next to "Justin Patrin" will be checked. If you choose the
     * "Female" gender the checkbox will be unchecked and it will say:
     * Justin Patrin - currently linked to - Male
     * 
     * If the link field is set as NOT NULL then FormBuilder will not process
     * an unchecked checkbox unless you specify a default value to set the link
     * to. If null is allowed, the link will be set to NULL. To specify a default
     * value:
     * <code>
     * <?php
     * class DataObject_Gender extends DB_DataObject {
     * //normal stuff here
     * 
     *   var $fb_reverseLinks = array(array('table' => 'person',
     *                                      'defaultLinkValue' => 5));
     * }
     * ?>
     * </code>
     * Now if a checkbox is unchecked the link field will be set to 5...whatever
     * that means. Be careful here as you need to make sure you enter the correct
     * value here (probably the value of the primary key of the record you want
     * to link to by default).
     * 
     * You may also set the text which is displayed between the record and the
     * currently linked to record.
     * <code>
     * <?php
     * class DataObject_Gender extends DB_DataObject {
     *     //normal stuff here
     * 
     *   var $fb_reverseLinks = array(array('table' => 'person',
     *                                      'linkText' => ' is currently listed as a '));
     * }
     * ?>
     * </code>
     * If you select "Female" the Justin Patrin entry would now say:
     * Justin Patrin__ is currently listed as a Male__

     * DB_DataObject_FormBuilder::_generateForm()
     *
     * Builds a simple HTML form for the current DataObject. Internal function, called by
     * the public getForm() method. You can override this in child classes if needed, but
     * it's also possible to leave this as it is and just override the getForm() method
     * to simply fine-tune the auto-generated form object (i.e. add/remove elements, alter
     * options, add/remove rules etc.).
     * If a key with the same name as the current field is found in the fb_preDefElements
     * property, the QuickForm element object contained in that array will be used instead
     * of auto-generating a new one. This allows for complete step-by-step customizing of
     * your forms.
     *
     * Note for date fields: HTML_QuickForm allows passing of an options array to the
     * HTML_QuickForm_date element. You can define your own options array for date elements
     * in your DataObject-derived classes by defining a method "dateOptions($fieldName)".
     * FormBuilder will call that method whenever it encounters a date field and expects to
     * get back a valid options array.
     *
     * @param string $action   The form action. Optional. If set to false (default), PHP_SELF is used.
     * @param string $target   The window target of the form. Optional. Defaults to '_self'.
     * @param string $formName The name of the form, will be used in "id" and "name" attributes. If set to false (default), the class name is used
     * @param string $method   The submit method. Defaults to 'post'.
     * @return object

     * from scratch, without any auto-generation. Use this for highly complex forms. Your getForm()
     * method needs to return the complete HTML_QuickForm object by reference.
     *
     * If you have a method named "postGenerateForm()" in your DataObject-derived class, it will
     * be called after _generateForm(). This allows you to remove some elements that have been
     * auto-generated from table fields but that you don't want in the form.

     * This will take the submitted form data and put it back into the object's properties.
     * If the primary key is not set or NULL, it will be assumed that you wish to insert a new
     * element into the database, so DataObject's insert() method is invoked.
     * Otherwise, an update() will be performed.
     * <i><b>Careful:</b> If you're using natural keys or cross-referencing tables where you don't have
     * one dedicated primary key, this will always assume that you want to do an update! As there
     * won't be a matching entry in the table, no action will be performed at all - the reason
     * for this behaviour can be very hard to detect. Thus, if you have such a situation in one
     * of your tables, simply override this method so that instead of the key check it will try
     * to do a SELECT on the table using the current settings. If a match is found, do an update.
     * If not, do an insert.</i>
     * This method is perfect for use with QuickForm's process method. Example:
     * <code>
     * if ($form->validate()) {
     *     $form->freeze();
     *     $form->process(array(&$formGenerator,'processForm'), false);
     * }
     * </code>
     *
     * If you wish to enforce a special type of query, use the forceQueryType() method.
     *
     * Always remember to pass your objects by reference - otherwise, if the operation was
     * an insert, the primary key won't get updated with the new database ID because processForm()
     * was using a local copy of the object!
     *
     * If a method named "preProcessForm()" exists in your derived class, it will be called before
     * processForm() starts doing its magic. The data that has been submitted by the form
     * will be passed to that method as a parameter.
     * Same goes for a method named "postProcessForm()", with the only difference - you might
     * have guessed this by now - that it's called after the insert/update operations have
     * been done. Use this for filtering data, notifying users of changes etc.pp. ...
     *
     * @param array $values   The values of the submitted form
     * @return mixed        TRUE if database operations were performed, FALSE if not, PEAR_Error on error
